# Notes:

```
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')
blogdown::install_hugo()
```

make a repo on Github
make a new RStudio project (New Project --> Version control)
```
library(blogdown)
new_site(theme="gcushen/hugo-academic",
         sample=TRUE,
         theme_example=TRUE,
         empty_dirs = TRUE,

```

- drag and drop OR continuous deployment?






delete the example posts, projects.  don't just move them elsewhere (site breaks).  WEIRD.





# Customization
- theme, font
- avatar, icon
- scss - header settings
- anchor links
- divtips
- leaf bundle


plot images in .Rmd: Main issue: do NOT ignore _files$ since that is where the images are kept!
options(blogdown.new_bundle = TRUE)    https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/351
AND CHANGE in config.toml.  
ignoreFiles = ["\\.ipynb$", ".ipynb_checkpoints$", "\\.Rmd$", "\\.Rmarkdown$", "_cache$", "\\.knit\\.md$", "\\.utf8\\.md$"]
