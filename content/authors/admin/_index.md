Hi!  I'm Arnie Seong, former poet & current PhD student in Statistics at the University of California, Irvine, working with Professors [Michele Guindani](http://www.micheleguindani.info/) and [David Rossell](https://sites.google.com/site/rosselldavid/).  My research focus is on Bayesian methods for clustering and local inference on functional neuroimaging data, with the goal of identifying neural correlates to stimuli.  In other words, I want to figure out which parts of your brain light up together, and for how long, when someone goes _poke poke_.

When I'm not doing stats, I enjoy hiking, skiing, poetry, blowing bubbles with my sons, and beer.  My newest hobby is stealing my kids' instruments to play classical music; Bach on a toy ukulele is actually pretty rad!  And before pursuing Statistics and data science, I was a college English instructor and poet; if you like, you can see a poem [here](https://www.montrealpoetryprize.com/poems/sonnet-for-the-tiny-neutron).

If you are interested in mixing data and music, check out [`datagoboop`](https://github.com/akseong/datagoboop#datagoboop), an R package for data sonification that I wrote with fellow students [Jaylen Lee](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jaylenl/) and [Sebastian Waz](https://lohdownonscience.com/meet-the-hive/sebastian-waz/).  If you make something with it, I'd love to hear what you create!
